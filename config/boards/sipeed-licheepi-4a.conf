# [    2.669998] random: fast init done

# FIXME(Krey): [FAILED] Failed to listen on systemd-networ…t - Network Service Netlink Socket.

# NOTE(Krey): The following commands are needed to make the fan to spin:
## echo 1 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/export
## echo 1000000 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm1/period

# NOTE(Krey): HDMI output doesn't work, but that might be cause I used minimal console image

# FIXME(Krey): Implement a method to handle flashing through fastboot to the eMMC namely separate:
## u-boot image
## boot
## root

# FIXME(Krey): I am unable to boot from an SD Card, but if uboot is placed on the eMMC it will allow sdcard initialization of rootfs

#! # SiPeed LicheePi 4A
#! System on Module board based on the T-Head TH1520 SoC with the chip, RAM, EMMC with a SODIMM-264 edge connector that slots into a platform board with additional devices.
#!
#! This documentation provides only armbian-specific instructions, refer to the official SiPeed Wiki for further details: https://wiki.sipeed.com/licheepi4a.html
#!
#! ## Flashing process
#!
#! ### Official Fastboot method to eMMC
#!
#! For the official method you will need `fastboot` often used to flash bootloaders on android devices and available in majority of Operating Systems and their distributions
#!
#! After successful build locate the u-boot binary, we will be using `u-boot-with-spl.bin`, but yours might have different name
#!
#! Disconnect the device from power, hold the 'BOOT' button and insert USB-C cable. On Linux it's recommended to monitor `# dmesg -w` to verify that your system sees the device and doesn't throw errors such as bad cable which will make the flashing unreliable.
#!
#! Verify that your fastboot sees the device
#!
#! ```console
#! # fastboot devices # Show Devices
#! ```
#!
#! You want to see `?????????????? Android Debugger` if that doesn't happen then seek help in the armbian support channel
#!
#! ```console
#! # fastboot flash ram ./output/images/u-boot-with-spl.bin # Flash the bootloader to temporary filesystem so that we can use it for flashing
#! # fastboot reboot # Reboot the device
#! ```
#!
#! Wait for the device to reboot, can be verified in `# dmesg -w`.
#!
#! Do NOT power the device with the 12VDC2A adapter, the flashing is done from the power provided by the USB-C cable
#!
#! ```console
#! # fastboot flash uboot ./output/images/u-boot-with-spl.bin # Flash the bootloader on the device
#! ```
#!
#! Verify in the output that the flashing was successful, if so proceed to flash the rootfs
#!
#! ```console
#! # fastboot flash root ./output/images/SOMETHING_HERE_AAAAAAAAAAAA.img_I_THINK
#! ```
#!
#! Flashing the rootfs might take some time, once it's done then disconned the USB-C cable, wait for the capacitors to discharge (~30 sec) and then power the device from the 12VDC2A adapter and you should be greeted by your Armbian Distribution

#! ## Kernel
#! As of 07.09.2023-EU the sipeed upstream appears to started work on linux mainline patches LTS 5.10.113 X months ago and are now in the process of porting in the current LTS[5] and BeagleBoard developers working on edge kernel for BeagleV-Ahead[1] that will then require cherry-picking for licheepi 4a
#! Thus Legacy is considered the most reliable atm, current as testing and edge as development branch

#! ## Known Issues
#! k.1. SuperTuxKart doesn't work with GPU Err
#! k.2. Playing CrabRave results in weird poping sounds
#! k.3. Chromium provided with `--no-sandbox` for some reason
#! k.4. glxgears are not glxgearing
#! k.5. Some genius though that it's a good idea to ancor the cooler just by thermal pad thing, expect it to keep falling and annoy the hug out of you, 3D printing/CNC community save MeEEEEeeEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEeeeeeEE and someone tell SiPeed in a diplomatic way to provide alternative cooler, bcs i suck at diplomacy
#! k.6. Serial console doesn't work until you re-flash the thing with new OS
#! k.7. The Slovenians still didn't added me in CODEOWNERS =..=
